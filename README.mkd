# Personal Boilerplate

I find that I always make the same adjustments to Paul Irish's [HTML5
boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) so I figure, why not simply
keep these changes in a git repository.

## Main Differences
* *Cleaned up js/ directory.* I found that I never really organized my
  scripts how the boilerplate prescribed.
* *No icons or image files.*
* *No build script.*
